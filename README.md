# Mac-Window-Manager

I wrote (work in progress) this applescript to open specified apps and place them in specified locations on your display(s). It's just for reference because my monitor resolutions most likely won't match anyone else's. 

I use this script every day to launch my Development applications and place them across my 3 monitors. You look super cool if you link this script to a keyboard shorcut and trigger it when you start the day.

enjoy.
